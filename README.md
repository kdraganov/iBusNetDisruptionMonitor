(SZ-1) Real-time visualisation of bus delays in London

A project in collaboration with Transport for London

On any given day, there are up to 9,000 buses on 670 routes running on the streets of London. These buses are operated by a number of independent commercial operating companies, but the network is centrally monitored and overseen by CentreComm. CentreComm is the London buses 24/7 control centre within Transport for London (TfL). From their control room in Palestra House, CentreComm field around 1,200 calls a day on emergency issues, disruption information and other relevant incidents. A team of 50 people working on a shift basis then needs to identify the causes of these problems and propose and implement diversions or other interventions to ensure a safe and efficient journey for bus customers.

CentreComm have access to large amounts of real-time data about buses, their locations and timings. However, this data currently must be manually analysed by a CentreComm officer to identify likely causes and possible interventions. As a result, CentreComm rely heavily on calls from bus operators and drivers in focusing their attention on particular routes and particular problems. The lack of pre-processed information creates a lack of disruption awareness and can potentially lead to the team focusing on the wrong issues; just because a particular operator "shouts the loudest".

This final-year project will develop a prototypical tool analysing CentreComm bus data and providing suitable visualisations to highlight the key hotspots that work should focus on. Ideally, such analysis would update in real time as more data comes into the system. Data will be made available by CentreComm. An analysis of what visualisations would be most helpful is part of the requirements analysis to be undertaken.

This is a challenging, but potentially very rewarding project, with a very good chance (if done well) of being used in CentreComm practice and influencing the way of work at CentreComm. CentreComm will provide data as well as some interaction with control-room staff to ensure the prototype delivers the best solution possible.
